# Wiremind Technical Test

This project predicts train ticket demand using machine learning. It is split into two parts: analyzing the data and building/evaluating the model.

## Files

1. `analysis_notebook.ipynb`  
   - Explores and analyzes the dataset

2. `model_notebook.ipynb`  
   - Builds and trains the prediction model  
   - Evaluates model performance and errors

## How to Run

- Start with `analysis_notebook.ipynb` to understand the data.  
- Then run `model_notebook.ipynb` for training and testing.

## Notes

- The dataset covers about one year and includes COVID-19 period disruptions.  
- The notebooks discuss data challenges and model limitations.  
- Suggestions for future improvements are included.
